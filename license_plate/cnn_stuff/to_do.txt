Wednesday
math exam >:(

remove copies of images
view augmented images

To Do:
    - figure out how to switch to using just conv.fit()
        since fit_generator seems to be what is complicated
            -for this, need to get data augmentation that
                is not from imagedatagenerator?
            - probably what is wrong is that since it is 
                just replacing data .. ???
            - should i be putting the images from the sim 
                into my training set also?

Tuesday
If images are too long split in half ???
finished (?) validation set. 
    - figure out what is causing weird stuff with cnn
    - integrate into sim to see if it works ok

Monday
have put code into .py files (from notebook)
labelled all the current split plates into a .csv file 

To do:
    - take more pictures of license plates in sim 
    - run thru the split process 
    - label >:(


Sunday
i have already made a bunch of training images and labelled them. 
now i need to make a validation set
thoughts:
    - take screencaps of stuff from the testing segmentation
    - take screencaps of stuff elsewhere?
    *** also include an option where it says "nothing" !! this might
        be difficult. need a training option on this too
        possibly take these from segmentation stuff as well...



PROJECT IDEA:
- make an auto-labeller: it takes images and asks u for each one what
    it is, then puts it into the corresponding folder
